Examples for decimal ↔ binary basics.

## Files

* `main.c` — demo: decimal and binary conversions.
* `dec_to_bin.c/.h` — decimal (unsigned) → binary string.
* `bin_to_dec.c/.h` — binary string → decimal (unsigned).
* `exercises_starter.c` — small exercises using the conversion functions.
* `Makefile` — build targets for main and exercises.
* `tests.sh` — quick self-checks.

## Build

```
make            # builds main and exercises
make run        # runs ./main
make test       # runs ./tests.sh
make clean      # remove binaries/objects
